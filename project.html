    <h1>Sundial</h1>
From wikipedial, the free encyclopedia
<p>A sundial measures time by the positon of the sun. The most
    commonly seen designs, such as the <em>'ordinary'</em> or standard garden 
    sundial. cast a shadow on flat <strong>surface</strong> marked with the hours of the 
    day. As the position of the sun changes, the time indicated by shadow
    changes. However, sundias can be designed for any surface where a fixed 
    object last a predictable shadow.

    Most sundial design indicate apperent solar time. Minor designed varriations
    can measures standard and <strong>daylight saving time</strong> , as well.</p>

    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>Sundials in the form of obelisks (3500 BC) and shadow clocks (1500 BC)
    are known from accient Eygyt, and were developed further by other
    cultures, including the Chinese, Greek and Roman cultures. A type of sundial without gromon is described in the old old Testament ( Isaih 38:2)

The mathematical and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia (Ca.160 BC - Ca 100 BC) is said to have invented
a <strong>suniversal sundial</strong> that could be used <em>anywhere on Earth</em>. The French astronomer Oronce Fine 
constructed a sundial of ivory in 1524. The Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovain published a treaties on the 
sundialin 1570, in which he included instruction for the manufacture and laying out mural (vertical) and
horizontal sundial. Giuseppe Biancanis construction instrument ad horologia solaria discuses how to make 
a perfect sundial, with a accompanying illustrations.</p>

<h2>Installation of standard sundials</h2>
<p>Many ornamental sundials are designed to be at 45 degrees north. By tilding such a sundial, it may be
installed so that it will <em>keep time</em>. However some mass-produced garden sundials are inacurrate 
because of poor design and can not be correced. A sundial designed for one latitude can be adjusted for
use at another latitude by tilting it base so that it style or gromon is <strong>parallel</strong> to the Earth's
axis of <em>rotation</em> so that it points at the north celestil pole in the northern hemisphere,
or the south celestial pole in the southern hemisphere.

A local standard time zone is normaly 15 degrees wide, but may be modified tto follow geographic and political
<em>boundries</em>. A sundial can be rotated around its style or gromon ( which must remain pointed at the celestial
pole) to adjust to the local time zone in most cases a rotation in the 7.5 degrees east to 23 degrees
west suffice.

To correct for daylight savings time, a face needs two sets of numerals or a correction table 

An information standard is to have numerals in hot color for summer, and in cool color for winter. <em>rotation</em>
the sundial will not work wwell because most sundials do not have equal hour angles.

Ordinary sundials do not conect apparent solsr to the time. There is a 15 minutes variation through
throughout the year, known as the equation of time, because the Earth's orbit is slightly elliptical and
its axis is tilted relative to planeot it orbit. A quality sundial will include a <strong>parmanetly-mounted table</strong>
or <strong>graph</strong> giving this correction for at least each month of the year. Some more - complex sundial 
have curved hour-lines, curved gromons or other arrangements to display the clock time</p>
